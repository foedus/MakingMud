Gameloop:

	User stuff -->
	Health regenerates
	Mana regenerates
	Experience absorbs
	* As soon as user becomes active, has it's own interval
	* As soon as everything maxes out, can clear interval since it won't do anything at that point which saves processing
	Room stuff -->
	Monsters appear
	Item appears
	Items decay
	Monsters move
	NPCs move
	NPCs do stuff
	Events happen (weather, atmospherics, random fluff)
	Both -->
	Dead bodies decay

Event based stuff:

	Attacks change health
	Spells change mana
	Kills change experience
	NPCs are interacted with
	Environment is interacted
	Players kill monsters
	Players search monsters
